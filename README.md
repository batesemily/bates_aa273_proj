# bates_aa273_proj

The code for this project is entirely contained in kalman_filtering_demo.py. 

Shape estimates were produced using Jeff Park's codebase [here](https://github.com/tpark94/sat-sq-recon/).

The SHIRT dataset, the source of the ground truth pose and state data, can be accessed [here](https://purl.stanford.edu/zq716br5462).

Apologies for the messy code! ðŸ˜¬
